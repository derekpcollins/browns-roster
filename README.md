## How to add the app on iOS

		<td>Tap the "Share" icon</td>
		<td>Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"</td>
		<td>Tap "Add"</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="/assets/img/screenshots/share-icon.jpg"></td>
		<td><img src="/assets/img/screenshots/add-to-home-screen.jpg"></td>
		<td><img src="/assets/img/screenshots/add.jpg"></td>
	</tr>
</table>

## What does the app look like?

<table>
	<tr>
